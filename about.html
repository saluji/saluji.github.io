        <h2>Hey there! I'm Erwin, a <strong>programmer & game designer</strong>.</h2>
        <p>
            I'm from germany and currently studying <strong><a
                    href=https://www.hs-ansbach.de/en/bachelor/visualization-and-interaction-in-digital-media/
                    target="_blank">VIS</a></strong>, specializing in game development.
            <br><br>
            Currently I'm developing in Unity, but I'm open to other game engines such as Unreal Engine and Godot.
            <br><br>
            I'm also capable of level designing & 3d modeling.
            <br><br>
            In my spare time, I'm working on my own project.

        <h2>I love video games</h2>
        <p>
            I mainly play JRPGs for their writing, world building and sometimes very niche gameplay.
            <br><br>
            Story, characters and world building makes me more immersed in this world and awakens strong emotions within me.
            <br><br>
            I don't mind any type of gameplay, be it turn-based, action, strategy and many more.
            <br><br>
            Finding harmony between those aspect is why I truly appreciate video games.
        <h3>Some of my favorite video game series</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Atelier</li>
            <li>Final Fantasy</li>
            <li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
            <li>Legend of Heroes</li>
            <li>Neptunia</li>
            <li>Persona</li>
            <li>Tales of</li>
            <li>Utawarerumono</li>
            <li>Ys</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><br> I love japan</h2>
        <p>
            I started learning japanese because of anime and appreciated its media.
            <br><br>
            Nowadays only really to learn more about its culture and especially the language.
            <br><br>
            Someday I want to visit Japan and explore hidden aspects in person, not known by many.
            <br><br>
            Also to eat their food and snacks since they are the best.
